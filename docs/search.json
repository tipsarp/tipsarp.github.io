    "text": "Veterinary medicine is an undeniably emotional profession. Veterinarians are subject to emotional distress on a regular basis, whether that is their own emotions—perhaps brought by the inevitable failure to save a patient— or the clients’ emotions, from losing a beloved pet. With this constant exposure to extremely emotional situations, it’s no wonder that many veterinarians experience empathic distress, eventually leading to burnout and, in some cases, leaving the profession.\nIn 2022-2023, I interviewed 21 early-career veterinarians in Canada, asking them about emotional experiences in their clinical practice as part of my doctoral thesis research, now published as the article, “A qualitative exploration of the emotional experiences and applications of emotional intelligence in early-career veterinarians”. This article below, summarizes the findings in a more digestible language."

    "section": "“Different people need different things.”",
    "text": "“Different people need different things.”\nCompassion, Understanding, and Empathy were crucial to communicating and connecting with clients and supporting them in highly emotional situations.\nMany veterinarians I know self-identify as very empathetic people.\nEmpathy can be extremely helpful in understanding and managing clients’ heightened emotions.\nMany veterinarians shared how much they appreciated their ability to understand clients’ emotions and needs, since it also led to providing better care for their clients’ pets.\nVeterinary schools in Canada teach skills relating to client communication, such as reading clients’ emotions, so it’s no surprise that many of the discussions we had around emotional intelligence were associated with client communication training.\nSome interviewees also showed appreciation for the respective client communication courses in their schools and linked their ability to understand clients with the communication labs/rotations, where they were able to practice these skills in a safe environment."

    "text": "“I’m honestly not the most emotionally intelligent person…”\nRecognizing the highly emotional nature of veterinary work, many agreed that being more proficient in emotional intelligence would be beneficial to their work.\nNot only in better understanding clients’ emotions, but also in understanding how their own emotions can surface at work.\nDespite many veterinarians self-describing themselves as “not the most emotionally intelligent person”, their understanding of how their emotions affect their work paints an entirely different picture.\nFor instance, as a veterinarian, regulating (or failing to regulate) your emotions can influence your clinical work and reflect on your interactions with colleagues.\nUnderstanding your emotions can also benefit your mental well-being, since it can help you gain insight into your feelings and uncover any hidden motivations behind them."

    "text": "Veterinarians in this study were more proficient in understanding and managing clients’ emotions than their own.\nThis is not an entirely unique phenomenon since healthcare workers tend to focus more on the patients’ emotions in the provision of care.\nFrankly, as a veterinarian, I would focus more on clients’ emotions, too, considering how stressful they can be. Not to mention, it’s an expected part of the job, and I’ve been trained to do so in clinical communications courses.\nOn the other hand, I’ve never been trained to regulate my own emotions— even worse, I’ve been told that it’s unprofessional for me to express my emotions at work.\nSo, in believing all of that, it would be much more effective for me to just shove my emotions away and deal with them later. (Which I may or may not do…)\nAnd the emotional intelligence proficiencies are just a reflection of that.\nAs we know, emotional intelligence is a set of skills that can be improved upon. And, the veterinarians in this study graciously shared some ways they used to improve their skills:\n\nSelf-reflection with personal support circle (partner, friends, family)\nSelf-reflection with professional support circle (colleagues, mentor)\nTaking relevant CE or wellness workshops\nCounselling or therapy\n\nIf you are a veterinarian (or know someone who is a veterinarian) who can relate to the findings presented in this series, I hope you’ve found this enlightening or affirming of your experience."

During my D.V.M., I sought out opportunities to expand my horizons, which led me to provide outreach with the Veterinary Volunteer club and practice my leadership skills with the International Veterinary Students Association.\n\nAs a dog person, I was delighted to research free-roaming dogs in Thailand for my M.Sc. in Veterinary Epidemiology, where I mastered (pun intended) advanced epidemiological and biostatistical methods such as Network Analysis.\n\nMy lived experiences and research paths converged, encouraging me to pursue my Ph.D. research on improving mental well-being in veterinarians using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods. My doctoral research solidified my appreciation of qualitative research methods, such as using thematic analysis on transcribed interviews, which shed light on findings that may not be within the reach of quantitative methods.\n\nThe wealth of knowledge that the past decade has brought me has inspired me to continue to broaden my horizons and welcome what future opportunities may arise."

Veterinarians are subject to emotional distress on a regular basis, whether that is their own emotions—perhaps brought by the inevitable failure to save a patient— or the clients’ emotions, from losing a beloved pet. With this constant exposure to extremely emotional situations, it’s no wonder that many veterinarians experience empathic distress, eventually leading to burnout and, in some cases, leaving the profession.\nIn 2022-2023, I interviewed 21 early-career veterinarians in Canada, asking them about emotional experiences in their clinical practice as part of my doctoral thesis research, now published as the article, “A qualitative exploration of the emotional experiences and applications of emotional intelligence in early-career veterinarians”. This article below, summarizes the findings in a more digestible language.\nContinue reading…"

    "text": "In 1980, Blair and Hayes discovered that veterinary professionals had higher suicide rates compared to the average population. Over 40 years and potentially hundreds of published studies later, what have we learned? And, more importantly, where are we headed next?\n\n\n\nFirstly, we’ve learned the common “adverse mental health outcomes” associated with being a veterinary professional (not unlike those of the drugs that vets prescribe to their patients). Those include stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout, to name a few.\nWe’ve learned that suicide and suicidal ideation remain prevalent in the profession, despite efforts from organizations such as Not One More Vet (NOMV) and others. Though we believe the situation to have improved, we currently don’t have enough research to know whether that is true.\nWe’ve also learned that these concerns exist in many countries around the world, as reported in, for example, the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. It’s important to highlight that the absence of reports in other countries does not mean the concerns do not exist, but that they were simply not reported.\n\n\n\n…but can also have perceived negative impacts on interactions with clients, teamwork, concentration, and decision-making, all of which can decrease the quality of care that patients receive.\nFrom the employers’ perspective, the veterinarians’ poor mental health and well-being increase the chances of absenteeism, attrition, and turnover, which could present significant economic costs.\nA study in 2022 estimated that the turnover and reduced working hours caused by burnout contributed to at least $1 - 2 billion in lost revenue annually in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThese “adverse mental health outcomes” have been found to be tied to occupational stressors such as long work hours, poor work-life balance, professional mistakes, unexpected outcomes, and ethical dilemmas.\nNewer studies have shown that the leadership and team environment play a pivotal role in making these stressors better or worse. For example, a focus group with veterinary technicians revealed that teams with toxic work environments also came with excessive workload, leading to burnout and staff turnover.\n\n\n\nWhile previous research has done a lot to uncover the concerns of mental health and well-being in the profession, there has been a collective shift to move away from that narrative.\nIn 2017, Cake advocated for more research that focuses on the positive aspects of veterinary work (which has always been eclipsed by the negatives in the past). A lot of veterinarians (myself included) love the profession, despite all the adverse effects that may come with it.\nPharmaceutical corporations innovate newer generations of drugs that become more effective while reducing the adverse effects. What if we could do the same for the veterinary profession? What if we can shift the newer generation of veterinarians away from these adverse effects that have been identified?\n\n\n\nAs mental wellness practices and positive psychology become more mainstream, they have spilled over into veterinarian mental health as well. With more and more studies reporting on positive outcomes such as resilience and positive functioning.\nMy team has also published research articles on meaningful work and emotional intelligence.\nAs we move forward, my hope is that we will see more research on the positive aspects of veterinary work and how we can make the profession more positive for everyone."
