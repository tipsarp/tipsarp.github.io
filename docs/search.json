    "text": "Veterinary medicine is an undeniably emotional profession. Veterinarians are subject to emotional distress on a regular basis, whether that is their own emotions—perhaps brought by the inevitable failure to save a patient— or the clients’ emotions, from losing a beloved pet. With this constant exposure to extremely emotional situations, it’s no wonder that many veterinarians experience empathic distress, eventually leading to burnout and, in some cases, leaving the profession.\nIn 2022-2023, I interviewed 21 early-career veterinarians in Canada, asking them about emotional experiences in their clinical practice as part of my doctoral thesis research, now published as the article, “A qualitative exploration of the emotional experiences and applications of emotional intelligence in early-career veterinarians”. This article below, summarizes the findings in a more digestible language."

    "text": "“Different people need different things.”\nCompassion, Understanding, and Empathy were crucial to communicating and connecting with clients and supporting them in highly emotional situations.\nMany veterinarians I know self-identify as very empathetic people.\nEmpathy can be extremely helpful in understanding and managing clients’ heightened emotions.\nMany veterinarians shared how much they appreciated their ability to understand clients’ emotions and needs, since it also led to providing better care for their clients’ pets.\nVeterinary schools in Canada teach skills relating to client communication, such as reading clients’ emotions, so it’s no surprise that many of the discussions we had around emotional intelligence were associated with client communication training.\nSome interviewees also showed appreciation for the respective client communication courses in their schools and linked their ability to understand clients with the communication labs/rotations, where they were able to practice these skills in a safe environment."

Not to mention, it’s an expected part of the job, and I’ve been trained to do so in clinical communications courses.\nOn the other hand, I’ve never been trained to regulate my own emotions— even worse, I’ve been told that it’s unprofessional for me to express my emotions at work.\nSo, in believing all of that, it would be much more effective for me to just shove my emotions away and deal with them later. (Which I may or may not do…)\nAnd the emotional intelligence proficiencies are just a reflection of that.\nAs we know, emotional intelligence is a set of skills that can be improved upon. And, the veterinarians in this study graciously shared some ways they used to improve their skills:\n\nSelf-reflection with personal support circle (partner, friends, family)\nSelf-reflection with professional support circle (colleagues, mentor)\nTaking relevant CE or wellness workshops\nCounselling or therapy\n\nIf you are a veterinarian (or know someone who is a veterinarian) who can relate to the findings presented in this series, I hope you’ve found this enlightening or affirming of your experience."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEmotions are integral to veterinary work. Despite rewarding experiences, veterinarians may also experience emotional distress, predisposing to burnout and possibly leaving the profession. Mastery of Emotional Intelligence (EI) has the potential to help veterinarians cope with emotional work demands, enhance teamwork, and improve client communication. Previous research suggests EI in veterinarians demonstrates opportunity for improvement. This study aimed to understand how validated measures of EI change throughout the first year of practice and describe early-career veterinarians’ experiences with managing intense emotions.\nThis study used mixed qualitative and quantitative methods. We conducted a longitudinal survey of the graduating Classes of 2022 and 2023 from the five veterinary schools in Canada, from graduation to 1-year in clinical practice (final time point: March 2024). The survey included the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire - Short form (TEIQue-SF) (range 1-7; higher scores reflect higher EI). Participants’ baseline (t1) (n=212) mean EI score (4.93, 95%CI 4.82 - 5.0-3) was marginally lower than the referent population (5.11, 95%CI 4.98 - 5.24). Cis-men and cis-women had higher EI scores than other genders (p=0.03). EI subscale analysis showed no difference in well- being and self-control, but marginally lower emotionality (5.04, 95%CI 4.90 - 5.17 vs. 5.25, 95%CI 5.11-5.39) and marginally higher sociability (5.39, 95%CI 5.24 - 5.54 vs. 4.97, 95%CI 4.84 - 5.1) than the referent population. Longitudinal modelling techniques will help determine how EI and its subscales change over time.\nTranscriptions of interviews with 21 early-career veterinarians (October 2022 – August 2023) are being thematically analyzed. Participants described the emotionally charged aspect of clinical work, acknowledged the importance of EI in practice, and shared pathways taken to improve their EI. Participants’ lived experiences acknowledge the benefits of EI on veterinarians’ clinical practice and well-being, highlight training gaps, and complement the opportunities for improving EI observed in the quantitative results."

    "text": "Abstract\n         The veterinary profession can be highly rewarding, but the emotional nature of clinical work can also contribute to mental distress and poor job satisfaction. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one’s own emotions and the emotions of others. In veterinarians, EI is increasingly recognized as a critical skill that can enhance client communication, teamwork, stress-coping, and mental well-being. The potential to enhance the retention of veterinarians in the profession is particularly important when considering the national shortage. The objectives of this study were to investigate factors that influence EI throughout the first year of Canadian veterinarians’ careers and to understand early-career veterinarians’ experiences with managing intense emotions in veterinary work.\n         A mixed qualitative (QUAL) and quantitative (QUAN) method was used to create a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of veterinarians’ mastery of EI and relevant experiences in clinical practice. An online longitudinal QUAN survey using validated psychometric scales and demographic and lifestyle questions was used to collect data at graduation with follow-up at 6- and 12-months post-graduation from individuals who graduated from one of the five Canadian veterinary colleges in 2022 and 2023 (n = 214). EI was measured using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire - Short form (TEIQue-SF) (score range 1-7; higher scores reflect higher EI). Data were analyzed using Linear-Mixed Models (LMM). Additionally, 21 QUAL interviews with early-career veterinarians conducted between October 2022 and August 2023 were transcribed and analyzed using template thematic analysis. A convergent explanatory mixed methods study design was used, combining the QUAN and QUAL results at the interpretation and reporting stages.\n         QUAN results revealed that, overall, the sample had marginally lower EI scores than the general population and significantly lower scores in Emotionality (understanding one’s emotions) and Sociability (influencing emotions of others). Factors that affected EI included social support, time spent outdoors, and mental health status. QUAL results highlighted participants’ perceptions of the sources of emotional distress and applications of EI in clinical practice. Challenging client interactions were highlighted as a frequent source of emotional distress. Understanding clients’ emotions and being empathetic were described as crucial aspects of client communication. Meanwhile, understanding and managing their own emotions were skills that helped some participants cope with work-related stress. Nevertheless, participants often indicated that they were unable to process their own emotions due to lack of time or prioritized clients’ emotions over their own, supporting the QUAN findings on lower scores in Emotionality. Combined, the results underscored the role of social support and discussed opportunities to improve EI, such as initiating EI training programs.\n         These findings support investment in EI training programs, as well as initiatives to develop meaningful social connections, which may also help improve EI in veterinarians. Strengthening EI in the veterinary profession could offer numerous benefits, including: strengthened interpersonal relationships, enhanced client communication skills, improved ability to manage external pressures, and improved overall mental well-being."

Veterinarians are subject to emotional distress on a regular basis, whether that is their own emotions—perhaps brought by the inevitable failure to save a patient— or the clients’ emotions, from losing a beloved pet. With this constant exposure to extremely emotional situations, it’s no wonder that many veterinarians experience empathic distress, eventually leading to burnout and, in some cases, leaving the profession.\nIn 2022-2023, I interviewed 21 early-career veterinarians in Canada, asking them about emotional experiences in their clinical practice as part of my doctoral thesis research, now published as the article, “A qualitative exploration of the emotional experiences and applications of emotional intelligence in early-career veterinarians”. This article below, summarizes the findings in a more digestible language.\nContinue reading…"

Over 40 years and potentially hundreds of published studies later, what have we learned? And, more importantly, where are we headed next?\n\n\n\nFirstly, we’ve learned the common “adverse mental health outcomes” associated with being a veterinary professional (not unlike those of the drugs that vets prescribe to their patients). Those include stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout, to name a few.\nWe’ve learned that suicide and suicidal ideation remain prevalent in the profession, despite efforts from organizations such as Not One More Vet (NOMV) and others. Though we believe the situation to have improved, we currently don’t have enough research to know whether that is true.\nWe’ve also learned that these concerns exist in many countries around the world, as reported in, for example, the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. It’s important to highlight that the absence of reports in other countries does not mean the concerns do not exist, but that they were simply not reported.\n\n\n\n…but can also have perceived negative impacts on interactions with clients, teamwork, concentration, and decision-making, all of which can decrease the quality of care that patients receive.\nFrom the employers’ perspective, the veterinarians’ poor mental health and well-being increase the chances of absenteeism, attrition, and turnover, which could present significant economic costs.\nA study in 2022 estimated that the turnover and reduced working hours caused by burnout contributed to at least $1 - 2 billion in lost revenue annually in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThese “adverse mental health outcomes” have been found to be tied to occupational stressors such as long work hours, poor work-life balance, professional mistakes, unexpected outcomes, and ethical dilemmas.\nNewer studies have shown that the leadership and team environment play a pivotal role in making these stressors better or worse. For example, a focus group with veterinary technicians revealed that teams with toxic work environments also came with excessive workload, leading to burnout and staff turnover.\n\n\n\nWhile previous research has done a lot to uncover the concerns of mental health and well-being in the profession, there has been a collective shift to move away from that narrative.\nIn 2017, Cake advocated for more research that focuses on the positive aspects of veterinary work (which has always been eclipsed by the negatives in the past). A lot of veterinarians (myself included) love the profession, despite all the adverse effects that may come with it.\nPharmaceutical corporations innovate newer generations of drugs that become more effective while reducing the adverse effects. What if we could do the same for the veterinary profession? What if we can shift the newer generation of veterinarians away from these adverse effects that have been identified?\n\n\n\nAs mental wellness practices and positive psychology become more mainstream, they have spilled over into veterinarian mental health as well. With more and more studies reporting on positive outcomes such as resilience and positive functioning.\nMy team has also published research articles on meaningful work and emotional intelligence.\nAs we move forward, my hope is that we will see more research on the positive aspects of veterinary work and how we can make the profession more positive for everyone."
