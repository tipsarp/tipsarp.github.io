# Bio

I am an interdisciplinary researcher and veterinary epidemiologist. My Masters' research applied Network Analysis to understand the potential rabies spread in a free-roaming dog population. During my Ph.D. my research focused on ways to improve mental well-being in veterinarians using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods.\

I currently work as a Research Fellow at [The Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) Foundation](https://www.hitap.net/en/home/) in Nonthaburi, Thailand.
